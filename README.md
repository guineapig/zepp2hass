## ✨ Features

### 📡 Real-time Data via Webhook

Zepp2Hass receives data from your Zepp smartwatch via a local webhook endpoint. When you configure the integration, it creates a unique webhook URL that accepts JSON payloads with all your health metrics.

**Rate limiting** is built-in to protect your Home Assistant instance: max 30 POST requests per 60 seconds per device.

### 🌐 Web Interface

Each webhook includes a minimalist web interface accessible via your browser, specifically designed for quick URL retrieval.

**How to find your URL:**

1. Navigate to **Settings** → **Integrations** → **Zepp2Hass**.
2. Select your **Device Name**.
3. Under **Device Info**, click **Visit** to open the interface.
4. Use the **one-click copy button** to grab your webhook URL.

### 📊 Comprehensive Sensor Suite

The integration creates multiple sensor types organized by category:

| Category           | Sensors                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Health**         | Heart Rate (last, resting, max), Body Temperature, Stress, Blood Oxygen |
| **Activity**       | Steps, Calories, Fat Burning, Stands, Distance (all with goal targets)  |
| **Location**       | Geolocation entity, Compass direction, Compass direction angle           |
| **Sleep**          | Sleep Score, Total Duration, Deep Sleep, Sleep Start/End Time           |
| **Workout**        | Training Load, Last Workout, Workout History, VO2 Max                   |
| **Device**         | Battery, Screen Status/AOD/Brightness, Device Info, User Info           |
| **PAI**            | Weekly PAI score with daily PAI as attribute                            |
| **Binary Sensors** | Is Wearing, Is Moving, Is Sleeping                                      |

### Movement Leaderboard Entity Mapping

Zepp2Hass creates stable entity unique IDs from the Home Assistant config entry plus the sensor key. Home Assistant entity IDs are generated from the configured device name and sensor name, so a config entry named `Zepp Sarah` normally produces entity IDs such as `sensor.zepp_sarah_steps`.

For Sarah, Flo, and Zora, create one Zepp2Hass config entry/webhook per watch and use clear device names such as `Zepp Sarah`, `Zepp Flo`, and `Zepp Zora`. If Home Assistant adds suffixes such as `_2`, keep the unique IDs stable and update the movement leaderboard mapping to the actual entity IDs shown in Settings > Devices & Services > Entities.

| Leaderboard key | Zepp2Hass sensor name | Example entity for `Zepp Sarah` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `steps_today` | Steps | `sensor.zepp_sarah_steps` |
| `fat_burning_today` | Fat Burning | `sensor.zepp_sarah_fat_burning` |
| `distance_today` | Distance | `sensor.zepp_sarah_distance` |
| `calories_today` | Calories | `sensor.zepp_sarah_calories` |
| `standing_today` | Stands | `sensor.zepp_sarah_stands` |
| `pai_today` | PAI | `sensor.zepp_sarah_pai` |
| `workout_minutes_today` | Workout Minutes Today | `sensor.zepp_sarah_workout_minutes_today` |
| `heart_rate_last` | Heart Rate | `sensor.zepp_sarah_heart_rate` |
| `stress_last` | Stress | `sensor.zepp_sarah_stress` |
| `wearing_status` | Is Wearing | `binary_sensor.zepp_sarah_is_wearing` |
| `battery` | Battery | `sensor.zepp_sarah_battery` |
| `last_update` | Last Update | `sensor.zepp_sarah_last_update` |

Profile/source diagnostics are exposed as `Profile ID`, `Profile Label`, `Profile Mode`, `Source App`, `Source Device ID`, and `Source Device Name` sensors. The movement leaderboard should treat these as identity/status data, not ranking metrics.

App-open location payloads from `tt_zepp_app` are exposed as a measured watch `geo_location` entity, for example `geo_location.zepp_sarah_location`. Location data is not written to Tagestracker helpers by Zepp2Hass.

## 🚀 Installation

### HACS ⭐

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant
2. Search for **Zepp2Hass** in HACS
3. Click **Download**
4. Restart Home Assistant

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Step 1: Add the Integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **Zepp2Hass**
4. Enter a **device name** (e.g., "My Zepp Watch", "Amazfit Band 7")
5. Click **Submit**

### Step 2: Get Your Webhook URL

After adding the integration, you can get your webhook URL:

**Integration Interface** - Go to Settings → Integrations → Zepp2Hass → Click on device name → Under "Device Info" click "Visit". This will take you to the web interface.

The URL format is:

```
http://YOUR_HOME_ASSISTANT_BASE_URL/api/webhook/WEBHOOK_ID
```

> **Advanced:** You can change the **Base URL** at any time by going to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Zepp2Hass** → **Configure**. The integration will automatically reload to apply the new URL.

### Step 3: Install and Configure the Zepp2Hass App on Your Watch

To send data from your Zepp smartwatch to Home Assistant, you need to install the **zepp2hass** app on your watch and configure it:

> **Prerequisites:** You need the **Zepp** app installed on your smartphone.

1. **Install the App from Zepp Store**
   - Open the **Zepp** app on your smartphone
   - Navigate to the **Zepp Store** (internal app store within the Zepp app)
   - Search for **"zepp2hass"** and install it on your smartwatch

2. **Configure the Webhook**
   - In the **Zepp** app, go to **Device Application Settings** → **More**
   - Find the **zepp2hass** app in the list
   - Enter the webhook URL you copied from Step 2
   - Optionally, adjust the **update interval** (default: 1 minute)
     - Increasing the interval (e.g., 2-5 minutes) will save battery life
     - Decreasing the interval provides more frequent updates but may drain battery faster

3. **Apply Settings on Your Watch**
   - Open the **zepp2hass** app directly on your smartwatch
   - Click the **"Apply settings"** button at the bottom

> **Tip:** For most use cases, a 2-5 minute interval provides a good balance between data freshness and battery life.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Sensors not updating?

1. **Check the webhook URL** - Visit it in your browser to verify it's accessible
2. **Check Home Assistant logs** - Look for errors under Settings → System → Logs
3. **Verify network** - Ensure the device sending data can reach Home Assistant

### Test the webhook with curl

```bash
curl -X POST http://YOUR_HA_IP:8123/api/webhook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "sensor-sarah-2026-06-15T10:00:00Z",
    "schema_version": 1,
    "record_time": "2026-06-15T10:00:00Z",
    "source_app": "tt_zepp_app",
    "profile": {"id": "sarah", "label": "Sarah", "mode": "full_checkin"},
    "device": {
      "watch_api_device_id": "tt-watch-0123456789abcdef",
      "source_app_device_id": "watch-install-..."
    },
    "battery": {"current": 80},
    "steps": {"current": 5000, "target": 10000},
    "heart_rate": {"last": 72, "resting": 58},
    "geolocation": {"status": "A", "latitude": 45.4642, "longitude": 9.1900},
    "compass": {"status": true, "direction": "NE", "direction_angle": 45},
    "is_wearing": 1
  }'
```

> **Note:** Replace `YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID` with the actual webhook ID from your integration. You can find it by visiting the webhook URL in your browser (GET request) or checking Home Assistant logs.

Expected response:

```json
{ "status": "ok" }
```

### Webhook response and payload rules

- Successful POST requests always return `{ "status": "ok" }`.
- Duplicate POST requests with an already-seen payload `id` are ignored and still return `{ "status": "ok" }`.
- Invalid JSON, non-object payloads, malformed known sections, or invalid coordinates return HTTP 400 with an error class and short message.
- More than 30 POST requests per 60 seconds for one Zepp2Hass entry return HTTP 429 `rate_limited`.
- Unsupported sensor categories should be omitted from the payload or listed under `capabilities.unsupported`.
- Temporarily unavailable categories should be omitted or listed under `capabilities.unavailable`.
- Missing or unavailable metrics become unavailable/missing entities in Home Assistant; they must not be sent as misleading zero values.

### 🐞 Debug Mode & Advanced Troubleshooting
